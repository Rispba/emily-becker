										<h1>Project 2: Instructions</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As a technical developer, I have made many different projects over the years. These are a few of my favorites- either to work on or with the end product.</p>

									<h2>Transformers Go! Kenzan</h2>
									<p>Kenzan is a Transformer toy, who was exclusively released in Japan. He is very near and dear to my heart, and I want more American people to understand him. For that reason, I made him the subject of my first ever major technical communication project- writing a simple series of instructions for something of our choosing.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="https://www.unicron.com/tfitem/itemimage_imgsrc.php?imageID=4414&size=9999" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Kenzan, being a toy, naturally came with instructions. However, I thought they seemed somewhat lacking, especially since I myself had trouble figuring him out. It took trial and error, specifically in dealing with his legs- which formed the helm of the car. </p>

									<h2>How to Clean Your Bathroom</h2>
									<p> For an instructional video class that I did recently, I made a video about cleaning the bathroom- something that I have had to do for many years now.</p>
									<p>The project was a cross-semester affair, with us picking our topic right at the start. Among other things, we had to write a script, read it into a mic, and record everything. Fortunately, I had help from various sources- and a little bit of ingenuity- in order to get the angles I wanted.</p>
									<p> Unlike most other students, however, I had an advantage-my father worked in the video editing industry for many years.</p>
