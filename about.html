								<p>Hello! My name is Emily Becker. I am a empathetic, hard-working, and curious technical communicator, who loves learning new things and interacting with new people. </p>

 
<br >
<p>My skills include UX research and design, SEO, graphic design, technical communication, and prototyping. I am also skilled in research and writing letters, pamphlets, and maps. I can even translate and research for academic papers. </p>

 
<br >
<p> I am also bilingual, having studied Japanese for almost 5 years. I passed the N5 and N3 Japanese Language Proficency tests, and have ties in the Georgian Japanese-speaking community. I have studied abroad in Japan twice, and have also been to China once. Each one of these adventures was a formative experience for me, opening my eyes to new cultures and ways of thinking. I am also able to adapt to using new languages fairly quickly, as long as I have a point of reference. </p>

 
<br >
<p>When I am not working, I can usually be found playing video games or watching streams with my friends. I am also an artist- although far from being professional, I enjoy doing it. I am a homebody, I will admit that much, but I am also very willing to get out of the house.</p>

 
<br >
<p>I do already have some job experience. My first real job was a summer one, working as a busier at the Cheesecake Factory. As mundane as that may sound, it taught me how to take orders and how I can help others even if I am not actively giving orders. Currently, I work for my university in a similar capacity. At the campus dining institution, Stingers, I sweep and mop floors with speed and accuracy. I also have experience in Chic-fil-a, which proved to me that I can work under great pressure. There, I helped bag orders and give people sauces, and often helped with cleaning after hours. I developed a strong sense of comradeship with my Chic-Fil-A coworkers, one I hope others can give me. </p>

 
<br >
<p>The kind of company that I want to be a part of is one that feels like a family- one that accepts me and considers me a valuable addition to the team. I have always been a softie for these kind of friendly environments, ones where I can learn and can help others learn and not feel embarrassed for not knowing everything. My dream company is the type where no man gets left behind, where everyone is (relatively) equal, and where I feel secure enough to truly be myself. </p>

 
<br >
<p>At heart, I am a humanitarian who is always willing to volunteer and lend a hand. I have participated in several food drives, volunteered at various organizations for my university’s day of service, and have volunteered as DragonCon for 3 years running. I love all things nerdy, so it’s always a lot of fun to see the costumes and interact with everyone. </p>

 
<br >
<p>As a group member, I consider myself to be the spark of inspiration. When I brainstorm, I make sure to give all of my ideas to the group and let them suss out the best ideas, and make commentaries on the ones that may not work as well. I also am a bit of a leader and planner, making sure everyone does everything that they are supposed to, and that they get it submitted on time. </p>

 
<br >
<p>I was born and raised in Connecticut, frequently jumping the border between there and Rhode Island. In my formative years, I learned all about teamwork and friendships. This was where I got my interest in web design and Information architecture, even if I wasn’t aware of what they were. However, when i was 9, I had another big moment. My father got a job in video editing, causing all of us to move down to Georgia. It was rocky at first, and I had to adapt to survive- and survive I did, flourished in fact. </p>

 
<br >
<p>In middle school, I had no clue what I wanted or what my major would be. My first thought was art school, namely SCAD, but it was expensive and seemed very far away. Throughout my life, I considered being a doctor, an author, a director, a game developer, and all kinds of other things. However, all of those had something that would turn me away, be it the gruesomeness, the competition, or naturally drifting away. My destiny was sealed when I went to an open house for Kennesaw State University. There, I saw a small booth for a practice called technical communication, something that I had never heard of. That moment was the one that brought much-needed clarity into my life and set me firmly down the path I am currently on. This is one path I am determined to stay on, no matter what gets in my way. </p>
