<h1> Hello! </h1> 

<p> My name is Emily Becker. I am a empathetic, hard-working, and curious technical communicator, who loves learning new things and interacting with new people. 

My skills include: UX research and design, SEO, graphic design, technical communication, and prototyping. I am also skilled in research and writing letters, pamphlets, and maps. 

When I am not working, I can usually be found playing video games or watching streams with my friends. I am a homebody, I will admit that much, but I am also very willing to get out of the house. 

At heart, I am a humanitarian who is always willing to volunteer and lend a hand. I have participated in several food drives, volunteered at various organizations for my universityâ€™s day of service, and have volunteered as DragonCon for 3 years running.
