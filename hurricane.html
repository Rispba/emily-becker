<h1> My first major project: Hurricane Relief</h1>

<p>For my Front-End Development class, I made a high-fidelity prototype of a website for hurricane relief. I used Adobe Dreamweaver, CSS, and Javascript to make this mockup. Research on already-existing hurricane relief sites was done, and iterated the prototypes based on the observations made. Pages included a donation page, a news page where future hurricane news reports could be added, and an about us page. Coding included making a scrolling image on the front page and using a knowledge of information architecture to successfully organize the website and make it easily accessible. </p>
